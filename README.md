# Sudoku-Solver
This Sudoku Solver is based on the Backtracking Algorithm.
Backtracking is a technique based on algorithm to solve problem. It uses recursive calling to find the solution by building a solution step by step increasing values with time. It removes the solutions that doesn't give rise to the solution of the problem based on the constraints given to solve the problem.
